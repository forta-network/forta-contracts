title: Redeploy to Mumbai 1.1.0 version
network: mumbai
deploy: run ./releases/1.1.0/customDeploy.js
verify: verify-deployed
description: |
  Deploy component contracts pre ScannerPools as they live in Polygon in version 1.1.0.
  This way we can test the migration from ScannerRegistry to ScannerPoolRegistry
  We still keep FortaBridgedPolygon, Access and Forwarder since these are not changed.
