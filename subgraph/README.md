# Forta Subgraph 
The Forta subgraph is currently hosted on chainstack (both dev and production enviornments) and provides visibility to on-chain events around the forta protocol such as staking, rewards, node pools, etc.

## Deployment

We use [theGraph's cli](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-studio/#deploying-a-subgraph-to-subgraph-studio) in our development and production github actions to deploy the Forta subgraph.

### Dev Deployment

The development deployment occurs on every pull request that is merged to master via a github action.

### Production Deployment

There are two production subgraphs which we follow a [blue/green deployment pattern](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-blue-green-deployment) via a github action.
