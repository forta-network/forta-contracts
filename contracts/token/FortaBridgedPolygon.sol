/**
 * This version of the Forta token is living on the child chain. That would be:
 * - Polygon for production
 * - Mumbai for testing
 *
 * When tokens are deposited from the root chain, the `childChainManagerProxy` will call the
 * {deposit} function, which will mint corresponding tokens on the child chain. The total supply
 * on the side chain is expected to match the amount of locked tokens on the parent chain.
 *
 * In order to bridge tokens back from the child chain to the parent chain, any (whitelisted) user
 * can call either the {withdraw} or the {withdrawTo} function. This will burn tokens here,
 * emitting a burn event (Transfer event from the user to address(0)) in the process. This burn event
 * is needed to trigger unlocking the corresponding tokens on the parent chain.
