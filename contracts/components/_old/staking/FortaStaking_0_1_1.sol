/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * @dev This is a generic staking contract for the Forta platform. It allows any account to deposit ERC20 tokens to
 * delegate their "power" by staking on behalf of a particular subject. The subject can be scanner, or any other actor
 * in the Forta ecosystem, who need to lock assets in order to contribute to the system.
 *
 * Stakers take risks with their funds, as bad action from a subject can lead to slashing of the funds. In the
 * meantime, stakers are elligible for rewards. Rewards distributed to a particular subject's stakers are distributed
 * following to each staker's share in the subject.
 *
 * Stakers can withdraw their funds, following a withdrawal delay. During the withdrawal delay, funds are no longer
 * counting toward the active stake of a subject, but are still slashable.
 *
 * The SLASHER_ROLE should be given to a future smart contract that will be in charge of resolving disputes.
 *
 * Stakers receive ERC1155 shares in exchange for their stake, making the active stake transferable. When a withdrawal
 * is initiated, similarly the ERC1155 tokens representing the (transferable) active shares are burned in exchange for
 * non-transferable ERC1155 tokens representing the inactive shares.
 *
 * ERC1155 shares representing active stake are transferable, and can be used in an AMM. Their value is however subject
 * to quick devaluation in case of slashing event for the corresponding subject. Thus, trading of such shares should be
 * be done very carefully.
 *
 * WARNING: To stake from another smart contract (smart contract wallets included), it must be fully ERC1155 compatible,
 * implementing ERC1155Receiver. If not, minting of active and inactive shares will fail.
 * Do not deposit on the constructor if you don't implement ERC1155Receiver. During the construction, the minting will
 * succeed but you will not be able to withdraw or mint new shares from the contract. If this happens, transfer your
 * shares to an EOA or fully ERC1155 compatible contract.
