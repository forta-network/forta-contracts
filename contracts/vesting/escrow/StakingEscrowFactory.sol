/**
 * Factory in charge of creating escrow instances for the vesting wallets. This factory, and the escrow instances are
 * on the child chain, where the staking contract exist. The vesting wallets are back on the parent chain, where they
 * are supervising vesting allocations.
 *
 * This is a trustless, non upgradeable contract. Anyone can create an escrow instance for a vesting wallet. The
 * escrow instance is automatically whitelisted on the forta token (on the child chain), but the manager isn't
 * (to avoid whitelist abuse). The manager will not handle tokens anyway. Manager can be the beneficiary of the
 * vesting wallet, or any other address. It has to be an address valid on the child chain.
 *
 * Anyone can instantiate an escrow for any vesting contract with any manager. It is ultimately the vesting
 * beneficiary that decide which manager to use when bridging token from the parent chain to the child chain.
 * The manager is the address of an EOA, or a smart wallet on the child chain, that will be the only one authorized
 * to operate on the escrow (see the {StakingEscrow}).
 *
 * Escrow instantiation uses create2 so that they can be deterministically predicted (in particular, by the vesting
 * wallet on the parent chain).
 *
 * @notice This contract must have the WHITELISTER_ROLE role on token
