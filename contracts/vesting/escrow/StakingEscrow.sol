/**
 * Logic for the escrow that handles vesting tokens, on the child chain, for a vesting wallet
 * on the parent chain. Instances are created as Minimal Proxy Clones.
 *
 * This contract contains some immutable parameters, common to all instances, that are set at
 * construction and some "normal" storage-based parameters that are instance specific and set
 * during initialization.
 * 
 * WARNING: DO NOT SEND FORT TOKENS TO THIS CONTRACT. It is designed only to handle bridged
 * tokens from `VestingWallet`, and the rewards that result from staking then in `FortaStaking`
 * If FORT tokens are sent to this contract, they can be bridged back to L1 VestingWallet,
 * but this process will slow down the release rate (not the dates, all FORT would be 
 * releaseble on vesting end).
 * If you have unvested tokens, interact directly with FortaStaking.
